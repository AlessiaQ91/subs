01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:08,080
## cause problems on both sides of this you know not 
## only on the people rejecting the idea side but  




947
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:13,280
## also the people demanding they be referred to as 
## a certain thing it's gonna oh it's only going to  




948
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:18,080
## become more prevalent i guess that's why i feel 
## like it's an important topic to get into well  




949
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:24,400
## again like you know yeah just cap this off with a 
## black and white answer and then sure you know it's  




950
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:30,880
## it works the other way as well like no bullying 
## will be allowed but also if you're bullying others  




951
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:36,560
## to believe what you believe at the cube that's not 
## a lot either if you're not required to hand it to  




952
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:42,080
## to give us your gender in that interaction and 
## you're forcing it anyways that's an issue yeah  




953
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:48,240
## that's a problem because that's not that's not 
## productive communication and uh and teamwork  




954
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:52,640
## when the goal is supposed to be non-human 
## animal rights yeah it goes both ways yeah  




955
01:35:54,560 --> 01:36:01,760
## sure just but basically just just respect each 
## other it's the bottom line earlier the answer to  




956
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:07,280
## it is everyone will be respected 
## that's the rule all right got it  




957
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:14,880
## all right cool cool let's uh we're going from 
## one to another i guess uh in terms of this i  




958
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,240
## think these might be a little bit easier to 
## get into though because there's just some  




959
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:23,360
## there's a few more like more direct accusations 
## that came through however they didn't really come  




960
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:28,240
## through with any kind of backing but i wanted 
## to put them to you as like a topic of like why  




961
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:32,240
## do you think people are saying this right and you 
## can tell me why you think people are saying this  




962
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:37,680
## so there's been accusations of of of racism 
## as well against av as an organization and also  




963
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:41,680
## i'm sorry paul but it tends to be coming at 
## you most of the time um with these things the  




964
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:47,760
## sal seems to get off the hook um but um this 
## racism apparently av is racist and apparently  




965
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,840
## paul is racist and i think some of this did 
## come from the the blm post um but that was  




966
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,760
## an av thing that wasn't necessarily a poll 
## thing why why do you think people are coming  




967
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:03,600
## at you and and making accusations that you 
## are a racist individually paul or not av  




968
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,440
## we'll deal with av in a second but why do you 
## think it's coming for you that people say this




969
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:15,520
## who isn't called a racist in 2020




970
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:21,760
## i'm suss on anyone not being 
## called a racist in 2020  




971
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:30,960
## uh why is i mean i'm answering quantum physics in 
## that question i don't know the answer it's like  




972
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:39,360
## uh yeah i don't know why why humans 
## the way they are i i just i really  




973
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:46,080
## i don't know it's uh i i actually haven't ever 
## heard anyone directly call me a racist because  




974
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:51,600
## of the blm poet like me personally yeah no no 
## that's that's like an av thing i think it's  




975
01:37:51,600 --> 01:38:01,840
## a general thing yeah i mean we have been called 
## a racist both of us not over that post though but  




976
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:10,560
## yeah i don't know why i'm not sure why actually 
## i'd like to see evidence your honor the evidence  




977
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:17,200
## please yeah i think there was there was there was 
## a post i'm just remembering now i think that it  




978
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:20,880
## could have i don't know contributed to it i 
## think where you would you were talking to a  




979
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,840
## you were outreaching a black guy and you said some 
## things about you know you defended the animals  




980
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:31,200
## um and i think some people found it to be 
## somehow racist because of the words you used  




981
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:36,960
## and do you remember that at all like yes black 
## guy was a black girl so you misgendered her  




982
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,400
## you should really be ashamed of 
## yourself let's cancel david immediately




983
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:47,360
## trust me trust me out of this video this is not 
## going to be the thing that gets taken there's  




984
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:50,560
## things we've said already that 
## i've as they came out of my mouth  




985
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,200
## i was like yeah that's going to be that's 
## going to be screenshotted that's going to  




986
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:58,240
## be all over the place soon so no don't worry 
## we're already that boat was sailed we're done  




987
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:07,920
## um so if you watch the video guys she was 
## making a point to me that she doesn't need  




988
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:13,200
## to take animal rights seriously especially 
## even if she is the oppressor in this scenario  




989
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:21,440
## as a non-vegan because black people are oppressed 
## that was her argument that she put to me  




990
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:28,080
## and she even said something to the effect that 
## speciesism doesn't apply to me and my people and  




991
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:34,960
## i said it applies to anybody who oppresses animals 
## who isn't vegan uh she carried on and i felt it  




992
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:41,760
## was only right to make the point that animals are 
## the most oppressed group of beings on the planet  




993
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:50,960
## it felt to me the most appropriate thing to say at 
## that time because i speak on behalf of the animals  




994
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,080
## if i was in their position that's 
## exactly what i would want to be  




995
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:57,440
## said in that moment so that that 
## person had the correct perspective




996
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:11,280
## uh whether they accept the truth is not my uh i 
## don't i don't have any uh skin in that game my
