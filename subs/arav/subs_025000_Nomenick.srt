02:50:02,640 --> 02:50:09,760
## uh like if hitler shows up to the cube should 
## he be respected like if he just is resurrected  




1702
02:50:09,760 --> 02:50:14,160
## from from the earth uh comes back to life 
## and shows up to keep will he be respected  




1703
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:22,720
## uh uh do i have to answer that oh we said everyone 
## should be respected we said we meant the person  




1704
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:30,080
## who chooses a different pronoun or name as well as 
## the person who might disagree with that ideology  




1705
02:50:30,800 --> 02:50:37,439
## oppressed that's what we meant we didn't say 
## the bully or the oppressor so oppression is  




1706
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:44,639
## not respected i thought that yeah like because we 
## led into that point with saying that actually and  




1707
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:53,359
## so yeah no totally totally i i understand this is 
## i think i watched a uh this thing with uh bilbao  




1708
02:50:53,359 --> 02:50:58,319
## you know the comedian bilbao he he he was talking 
## about new ones as well do you know the ginger guy  




1709
02:50:58,319 --> 02:51:02,240
## and speaks really quickly i don't know if you know 
## what i'm talking about yeah cool so he he talked  




1710
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:07,760
## about nuance as well he was saying that like 
## everything i say is twisted and he said something  




1711
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:12,399
## like he said he was talking about consent right 
## and i'm i'm gonna by the way for anyone that's  




1712
02:51:12,399 --> 02:51:16,719
## looking for something to get me on here this is 
## bill burr's words not my words all right don't  




1713
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:22,160
## [ __ ] start here um but basically he said like 
## today's world like how how do you even work right  




1714
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:26,639
## so he said like it's all about consent and there's 
## you're at risk all the way always and he said how  




1715
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:32,319
## do you have it rough now like if a girl wants it 
## rough how do you do that because you know how does  




1716
02:51:32,319 --> 02:51:37,599
## it work right and this guy in the crowd shouted 
## you need to get consent first and he was like  




1717
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:43,439
## this is why you can't make jokes anymore he was 
## like this [ __ ] [ __ ] thinks that i'm saying  




1718
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:48,560
## that i was not going to get consent i never said 
## that he was like when did i say that why would you  




1719
02:51:48,560 --> 02:51:53,279
## assume that that's what i meant right and he was 
## like it's [ __ ] ridiculous you assumed the worst  




1720
02:51:53,279 --> 02:51:57,599
## of me and he called this guy an idiot and a [ 
## __ ] and like really slammed him for shouting  




1721
02:51:57,600 --> 02:52:02,399
## that because it's like i'm not a monster dude 
## like i'm making a joke about rough sex i'm not  




1722
02:52:02,399 --> 02:52:06,559
## making a joke about not getting consent are 
## you insane there's a very big difference and  




1723
02:52:06,560 --> 02:52:10,399
## this is i'm saying it because he commented on it 
## and it's kind of what's just happened here it's  




1724
02:52:10,399 --> 02:52:16,000
## like you guys said respect everyone and someone 
## understood that as respect transphobic people  




1725
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:22,720
## it's like no that's not what i said no one said 
## that jesus do you think i would have let that fly  




1726
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:27,520
## in the conversation do you really think i am that 
## morally corrupt that i would just let someone say  




1727
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:31,040
## that on my channel and just not question wait 
## a minute you've just said you want to respect  




1728
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:36,160
## transphobes it's like no i would never let that 
## go even if i had someone like some monster on  




1729
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:39,680
## the channel i would never i wouldn't let 
## that go but that's not the case you know  




1730
02:52:40,560 --> 02:52:43,920
## anyway i'm just i've just got off the handle a 
## bit there but we're at the end anyway it's fine




1731
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:53,600
## it's just as silly as having to say oh with the 
## exception of intersex when you're saying there's  




1732
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:58,640
## two sexes like why should we even have to say that 
## it's an anomaly of course that's an exception to  




1733
02:52:58,640 --> 02:53:06,800
## the rule and like you know you don't need to 
## say certain things i guess if you are reading  




1734
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:14,800
## between the lines and you are attuned to nuance 
## and you don't just see things through this uh  




1735
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:21,279
## cancel culture lens where you know is it what what 
## billboard said is these days you say something and  




1736
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:26,719
## what you say goes into someone's brain and then 
## it gets cut with all of the things that they're  




1737
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:33,359
## conditioned with and you know and then it comes 
## out of their brain they spit it out after that  




1738
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:37,599
## you know according to what they perceive it to be 
## and it's usually completely different to what you  




1739
02:53:37,600 --> 02:53:44,080
## said and uh it's the same thing here it shouldn't 
## that shouldn't that's something that shouldn't in  




1740
02:53:44,080 --> 02:53:48,160
## my opinion shouldn't need to be clarified you 
## should assume the best in people not the worst  




1741
02:53:48,800 --> 02:53:53,680
## i i don't understand what you what you have done 
## or even what i have done because i'm involved  




1742
02:53:53,680 --> 02:53:58,240
## in this that question was for all of us right 
## because i they're assuming that you have said  




1743
02:53:58,240 --> 02:54:03,920
## that and i have i have been like yeah great cool 
## like what did i do to deserve that what did you  




1744
02:54:03,920 --> 02:54:08,479
## do to deserve that assumption like i i don't think 
## any of us has done anything particularly you know  




1745
02:54:08,479 --> 02:54:13,200
## that horrible to think that any of us would like 
## believe that or let it go it's such a strange  




1746
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:17,359
## and i think the person's saying it innocently 
## enough i don't think they're trying to attack  




1747
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:24,960
## but at the same time it's like dude be reasonable 
## here come on it's a fair enough question um but i  




1748
02:54:24,960 --> 02:54:29,600
## mean i i don't know is it fair enough actually am 
## i trying to be nice i don't think it's fair enough  




1749
02:54:29,600 --> 02:54:34,160
## at all in my opinion i think it's something that 
## if you watched the whole conversation and listened  




1750
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:39,359
## without assuming the worst in all three of us you 
## would come to the conclusion that that that's not  




1751
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:43,279
## what was being said like that you're not going 
## to respect a bigger you're not going to respect  




1752
02:54:43,279 --> 02:54:48,639
## someone who hates trans people like what the [ 
## __ ] like what kind of rational person would ever  




1753
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:55,439
## have irrational hatred or acceptance of irrational 
## hatred like it's not it's not rational to accept  




1754
02:54:55,439 --> 02:55:01,279
## that and we've i don't believe we've been acting 
## irrationally in this conversation so i just i
