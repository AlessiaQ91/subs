02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:10,720
## know i i agree with you i don't like bringing 
## this up because there's no i've got nothing to  




1451
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:15,280
## show you know what i mean and i feel like i've had 
## multiple conversations i've had conversations i'll  




1452
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:19,120
## be honest with you i've had conversations with 
## people that i would consider to be good friends  




1453
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:25,120
## and i've had to be quite harsh and say look 
## either give me something here or you're full of  




1454
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:30,000
## [ __ ] like i'm sorry and we've kind of like got 
## into an argument and just agreed to disagree on it  




1455
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:35,200
## because they wouldn't give it to me because they 
## didn't have it and um so i've got to say i hold  




1456
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:40,479
## i hold a bit of a bias on this because i've 
## experienced the [ __ ] first hand and it's it's  




1457
02:25:40,479 --> 02:25:45,040
## really disappointing to see and it kind of happens 
## to me as well obviously people say things about me  




1458
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:49,200
## and i say okay great give me some evidence tell 
## me where i've said that and they disappear you  




1459
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:57,359
## know um so i it's it's it's a it's a symptom 
## of a larger problem i think yeah um yeah yeah  




1460
02:25:58,479 --> 02:26:04,319
## for sure yeah and then the final the final 
## thing we'll go into then is actually about  




1461
02:26:04,319 --> 02:26:08,880
## the effectiveness of av so this is a good thing 
## or not just av but of animal rights activism but  




1462
02:26:08,880 --> 02:26:13,600
## the activism that we're doing so somebody 
## did message me and they told me um ask them  




1463
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:18,800
## they started off with a shitty message they said 
## ask them why why the cube of truth doesn't work  




1464
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:23,280
## so i was like okay what are you talking about they 
## said right look the number of animals being killed  




1465
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:29,359
## is on the rise and um the challenge 22 sign ups 
## for last year i think it was last year was only 2  




1466
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:34,160
## 000 in the entire world so clearly it's not 
## working so i broke that down into two sections  




1467
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:38,720
## and this is two things i want to go through like 
## one side of this is that obviously if the number  




1468
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:42,880
## of animals being killed is increasing it's not 
## just av that's not working it's every single  




1469
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:48,080
## activism group that's not working because clearly 
## you know save isn't working dxe isn't working  




1470
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:51,359
## direct action isn't working hunt's tabs aren't 
## working nothing's working because the amount of  




1471
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:56,960
## animals being killed is on the increase right 
## so that's that's a topic why is that happening  




1472
02:26:56,960 --> 02:27:03,200
## um you know what can we do about it as one topic 
## and the other topic is um why the um challenge the  




1473
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:09,920
## vegan 22 av signups um they seem to be a lot 
## lower than what would be expected of a of you  




1474
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:14,399
## know considering how much work goes in into the 
## cubes right so i think let's maybe start with the  




1475
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:18,639
## challenge 22 one because that might be an easier 
## quicker one to go into and then we'll close on the  




1476
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:23,439
## on the set on the other one so what with 
## the challenge 22 reporting um firstly is  




1477
02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:28,160
## that accurate like what's going on with that or 
## how is it only at 2 000 for like the whole year  




1478
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:34,800
## nah first of all it's not accurate because many 
## people wouldn't use it also at some point we  




1479
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:40,560
## stopped promoting it and using it anyway because 
## we realized that challenge 22 is now really  




1480
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:48,720
## aligned with av in terms of how they promote 
## veganism and so we stopped promoting it and maybe  




1481
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:54,640
## some organizers some volunteers are still using 
## that link when they arrest someone at a cube but  




1482
02:27:55,600 --> 02:28:01,840
## it's not being done the same way anyway i think 
## when did we start doing this when we when did we  




1483
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:09,920
## stop using the link last year at least a year and 
## a half yeah wait it's it could even be up to two  




1484
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:14,960
## years now but it's at least a year yeah i think it 
## was last year at some point we realized that we're  




1485
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:21,760
## just not aligned we stopped using it and um even 
## when we were promoting it and it was on the card i  




1486
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:27,920
## can average someone and i can say you know you can 
## go and sign up and use this link but that person  




1487
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:32,160
## is not necessarily going to do it even if they 
## do decide that they want to be vegan so that's  




1488
02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:37,280
## why it's not a good measurement and we all the 
## way that we communicate animal rights to people  




1489
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:44,319
## is so simple and easy to digest and with so much 
## personal individual accountability attached to it  




1490
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:52,080
## that the why factor is is something we focus so 
## heavily on hammering into people that the how  




1491
02:28:52,080 --> 02:29:00,399
## factor is something we empower generally we 
## empower other the the bystander to take on within  




1492
02:29:00,399 --> 02:29:06,879
## their accountability it's their responsibility 
## to be to be to you know properly plan how they're  




1493
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:12,399
## going to be vegan by simply using google and we 
## we sometimes say exactly that you know google is  




1494
02:29:12,399 --> 02:29:17,839
## all you really need to be to be vegan uh we want 
## it to be simple for people we don't want to make  




1495
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:23,520
## it sound like you need to be in a 22-day program 
## when that's not even true you don't the fact is  




1496
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:29,120
## you do not need that is it helpful for some people 
## but not for everyone and that's not the message  




1497
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:35,439
## that we believe is important we need to clarify 
## it further by saying all that's needed is the  




1498
02:29:35,439 --> 02:29:42,240
## why factor the how you will figure out if there 
## were vegans 50 years ago you can be vegan now




1499
02:29:44,399 --> 02:29:49,040
## absolutely okay i think i think that's i'll give 
## you my personal opinion on that as well because  




1500
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:55,760
## i think that's fair um and i think i don't know 
## to gauge the success or or failure by how many  




1501
02:29:55,760 --> 02:30:00,399
## challenge 22 sign-ups seems a little bit there 
## are seems a bit short-sighted uh considering
