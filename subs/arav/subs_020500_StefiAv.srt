1237
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:10,160
## the longer it will take for animal rights 
## to be taken seriously in the public eye




1238
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:16,800
## i think i can't remember which one of you said 
## it or if it actually was one of you but um there  




1239
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:22,800
## was a quote that vegetarians are contributing to 
## one less form of animal abuse than a meat-eater  




1240
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:27,840
## they contribute to every other form of 
## animal abuse it's just not just not meat  




1241
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:32,240
## just not flesh and that that was quite for me 
## that was very powerful and i feel like that  




1242
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:36,320
## that was that was a quote that was a sentence that 
## really brought it home to me that actually yeah  




1243
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:42,560
## we we we should be targeting vegetarianism 
## as you know just the same as we would target  




1244
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,640
## anyone else you know who's a non-vegan because 
## it's just it's just there's only one between  




1245
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:52,400
## them even more yeah even more because non-vegans 
## don't say you don't need to talk to me unknown  




1246
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:58,320
## they know that they need that's the correct 
## conversation to have with them they know that  




1247
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:03,760
## they're culpable right it's the same as someone 
## who's non-vegan who doesn't support animal testing  




1248
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:09,440
## they never buy cosmetics that are tested on 
## on animals i mean they don't support one form  




1249
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:15,760
## of animal injustice yeah there are many numbers 
## they don't claim that claim to be exempt from the  




1250
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:20,400
## message regarding meat dairy and eggs vegetarians 
## do claim to be exempt from hearing that  




1251
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:28,240
## yeah it's just very counterproductive to separate 
## like vegetarians and the rest of non-vegans  




1252
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:33,840
## because i see that a lot from vegans and animal 
## rights activists they think that they should get  




1253
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:38,000
## a different treatment but really vegetarians 
## are just non-vegan so let's not separate them  




1254
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,480
## the reason why we focus on it is because we want 
## to change their mentality it's not because there  




1255
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:48,560
## is any difference you know we're not like singling 
## them out it's the same it's just non-vegans  




1256
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:56,560
## it's just clarifying the message on behalf of 
## the animals okay perfect yeah i yeah this for  




1257
02:06:56,560 --> 02:07:02,720
## me was an easy topic because i'm i also uh focus 
## on vegetarians for the same reasons um i think i  




1258
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:06,240
## think it's something our movement really needs to 
## needs to shape people need to shake their head on  




1259
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:10,320
## this and just realize that these vegetarians 
## they're not helping us they're not our allies  




1260
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:16,160
## um understanding veganism doesn't help anyone like 
## oh i understand you or i'm supportive of you i'm  




1261
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:21,840
## a vegetarian it doesn't mean [ __ ] and i think 
## the more we start to realize that the better and  




1262
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:28,480
## the easier things are going to be in the long 
## term um so a style actually i have a specific  




1263
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:34,000
## topic for you and this was this was actually only 
## brought up yesterday um so that's why i don't know  




1264
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:40,480
## if you've got chance to um yeah i'll i'll i'll 
## explain it now so basically the impossible burger  




1265
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:44,960
## all right uh you did your video when when was 
## it earlier this year i don't know if you've  




1266
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:50,640
## thought about it since then but um i think 
## it's been like two years now is it two years  




1267
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:55,600
## wow okay i don't know i watched it only recently 
## anyway so i don't know if you've had a chance to  




1268
02:07:55,600 --> 02:08:00,560
## catch up on on that and or if you still think the 
## same but um somebody brought this up and they're  




1269
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:05,920
## very passionate about it and they wanted to uh 
## discuss this um apparently according to them  




1270
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:11,920
## again don't know if this is true or not a lot of 
## people left or at least stopped going to cubes or  




1271
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:17,040
## even some chapters maybe even closed over 
## a disagreement about the impossible burger  




1272
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:22,000
## and the video that you made i watched the video 
## obviously i watched the video i i only watched  




1273
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,120
## it yesterday so it's fresh in my mind um and your 
## position's on the impossible burger and i you know  




1274
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:30,800
## went through it and what what how do 
## you respond to people who who have this  




1275
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:37,760
## like they don't believe that av is abolitionist 
## because of you being the founder holding the view  




1276
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:44,880
## that you hold that uh an impossible burger um is 
## it's it's vegan because they tested on animals um  




1277
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:48,960
## i'll i'll explain the video if you want really 
## quickly for anyone that's watching real quick i  




1278
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:52,960
## watched it yesterday so it's really fresh in the 
## video assal basically makes the position makes  




1279
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:58,480
## the claim i don't know takes the position that 
## practically every single e number and additive  




1280
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:03,920
## has been tested on animals at one point so pretty 
## much every vegan product you would buy has has  




1281
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:07,600
## something in it that has been tested on animals 
## but not by the company that you're buying it from  




1282
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:13,840
## uh the impossible burger and possible foods did 
## the testing themselves and but the product now  




1283
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:18,720
## that's in the store technically hasn't been tested 
## on it's the product that the one thing that was in  




1284
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:23,760
## it was previously tested so therefore it's in the 
## same category as another item that you would buy  




1285
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:29,600
## um they're both been tested at some point um 
## and if you take issue with the impossible burger  




1286
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:34,480
## then how long does it have to be before we don't 
## take issue with it anymore and it becomes in the  




1287
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:38,960
## same category as the other products that have 
## once tested on animals that's the position that  




1288
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:44,720
## a cell takes so if anyone's got a question about 
## that either superchat it or save it for later  




1289
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:47,280
## but yeah how do you how would you 
## respond to someone now who says right  




1290
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:53,120
## that that makes av non-abolitionist because 
## av is supporting a product that was tested  




1291
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:57,120
## on animals and they take the position that 
## because impossible foods did the testing  




1292
02:09:57,120 --> 02:10:02,320
## and they have not actually said they wouldn't test 
## the gain so impossible have said they will test
