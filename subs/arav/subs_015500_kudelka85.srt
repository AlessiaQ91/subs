1140
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:13,360
## it's not just an opinion that we had this was 
## really happening and uh that was the issue that  




1141
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:20,400
## you're pointing out david sure and and george and 
## another individual they were removed from the team  




1142
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:24,640
## was was that because of this specific example or 
## was there another reason that these individuals  




1143
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:31,040
## were removed there was another question somebody 
## asked that was one of the comments but there were  




1144
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:39,280
## other comments left um by george but also it was 
## the conversations we had in private with them  




1145
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:45,840
## about the issue i believe the comments were 
## about um denying that systemic oppression exists  




1146
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:55,680
## and how that comment was left by our social media 
## members without them running it by us and that's  




1147
01:55:55,680 --> 01:56:04,640
## not something that um just didn't align with us 
## or av or other team members so that's why we had  




1148
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:10,400
## to have private conversations to clarify this and 
## that and during those conversations we realized  




1149
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:16,000
## that we're just not aligned and it was just not 
## possible at that point to have them on the team  




1150
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:23,360
## yeah just to clarify yeah because it might be 
## confused by people in what we're saying here uh  




1151
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:28,960
## that like gemma and george were like fired on 
## the same premise they weren't removed from ab  




1152
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:35,200
## on the same premise there was a different uh 
## scenario for those both individuals like we  




1153
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:39,200
## a different decision process for both 
## those individuals there were different  




1154
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:43,520
## things that occurred with george as well it 
## wasn't just one thing it wasn't one comment  




1155
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:48,880
## or one point multiple comments and then 
## multiple conversations that we were having that  




1156
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:56,160
## made it clear that yeah but it was different 
## and it wasn't just this no i was like another  




1157
01:56:56,160 --> 01:57:01,840
## example was about how because the comment that 
## you just read out i didn't remember that one  




1158
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:10,480
## but i know there was another one going around 
## what our team said systemic oppression doesn't  




1159
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:15,680
## exist in the west or something like that which 
## we were getting lots of messages about and so i  




1160
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:19,520
## do remember that very clearly right there 
## were i think there were multiple things  




1161
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:25,360
## otherwise we wouldn't just ask someone to leave 
## the team over one comment especially someone who  




1162
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:32,320
## was an asset to the organization george was 
## a prized member of the team whom i really  




1163
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:37,840
## liked working with and i thought that he was a 
## great member so it's ridiculous that we would  




1164
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:44,800
## um yeah it's tough to be in this position 
## um you know that's the thing also like  




1165
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:54,080
## it sucks to have to fire someone like george 
## yeah i just want to add because it's okay to have  




1166
01:57:54,080 --> 01:58:00,960
## your own political views your religious 
## views but if you are commenting as a v  




1167
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:07,440
## as a part of the team and then those views are 
## coming through your comments and your messages  




1168
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:12,960
## then that's not okay because within the team 
## like i said we have over 20 people or something  




1169
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:19,440
## and we all have different views and then we have 
## our own political views or our own views on god  




1170
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:24,800
## or religion or whatever but you never see us 
## commenting about it when we're commenting as a  




1171
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:30,720
## v because av is supposed to represent something 
## that is just about the animal so regardless of  




1172
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:36,240
## your views you can be a part of that and that 
## was the issue that it was just not possible to  




1173
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:43,200
## to have that with those individuals and people 
## don't seem to be wanting to work with us to create  




1174
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:49,440
## the most conducive organization 
## that is dedicated to the animals  




1175
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:55,840
## people don't seem to be working with us to 
## achieve this we seem to be dedicated to it and  




1176
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:03,040
## everyone seems to be pushing back and pushing 
## back and pushing back we are open to ideas we  




1177
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:09,440
## want to see how we can help other like other 
## things here but we have like assa was saying  




1178
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:14,720
## we have other people in the organization who have 
## even stronger political views than george do than  




1179
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:20,960
## george does even stronger political views than 
## than george does think i mean think about that  




1180
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:29,600
## you know yeah sure and they don't they don't ever 
## they never let their advices come through their  




1181
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:36,640
## work so that's but again when it's not to focus on 
## just one point here because it wasn't just one a  




1182
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:43,360
## one-dimensional decision it was multi-dimensional 
## and that that's also kind of entwined with the uh  




1183
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:49,440
## intertwined the with another kind of criticism i 
## had about the comments like uh there were i don't  




1184
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:54,480
## know if there still are i haven't seen any since 
## this but there were quite a lot of let's say rude  




1185
01:59:54,480 --> 02:00:01,680
## comments um on on the av social media let's say 
## like sometimes i think i even saw one someone
