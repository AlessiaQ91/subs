02:30:00,399 --> 02:30:05,759
## that you know you see conversations with someone 
## like you know hudson for example he was a great  




1503
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:10,960
## activist and some of his conversations just you 
## blow someone's mind you know and do they sign up  




1504
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:16,640
## for vegan 22 maybe not but but their mind has been 
## blown like you know you can't undo that like maybe  




1505
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:22,080
## they don't do vegan 22 but the idea that they 
## could potentially go vegan is still is still there  




1506
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:27,920
## you know they've definitely made some connections 
## so i think engaging the success based on that is  




1507
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:32,000
## is a little bit well not a little bit it's very 
## short-sighted and it does it does bring up the  




1508
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:36,800
## question though of of how can we gauge success 
## right because currently this leads on to the  




1509
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:41,600
## next question that we can gauge our failure by the 
## amount of animals being killed on the rise right  




1510
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:46,319
## so that that's something i feel that we all have 
## to take as a bit of a slap in the face like okay  




1511
02:30:46,319 --> 02:30:51,840
## we're trying but you know clearly something isn't 
## working as effectively as we'd like it to be or  




1512
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:58,000
## we've got a long way to go right um so how can we 
## gauge success how can we know that we're working  




1513
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:03,200
## towards you know the right place when it looks 
## like we're not if you look at the global statistic




1514
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:11,200
## hey look i would agree that animals and the 
## animal rights movement has been pushed back  




1515
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:14,960
## even further this year than it was 
## last year i would agree with that




1516
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:22,160
## all right yeah but to say that we shouldn't 
## fight for animals in the way that we're doing it  




1517
02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:31,599
## is ridiculous uh i i would judge incremental wins 
## by saying that you know in our network i'm seeing  




1518
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:38,161
## more and more people than ever before speaking 
## correctly about this and that's beautiful okay  




1519
02:31:39,359 --> 02:31:43,200
## we're ending human supremacy we're holding 
## people accountable and we're spreading a clear  




1520
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:50,560
## vegan message on behalf of the animals so for 
## me that's what that's one win that i would use  




1521
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:56,000
## as an indicator for us moving in the right 
## direction and i think more and more vegans are  




1522
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:06,880
## taking on board this this need to to be serious 
## about how we're being perceived by others and like  




1523
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:11,040
## taking that seriously and being wanting wanting 
## to be taken seriously when it comes to this  




1524
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:20,240
## uh i don't even think that many others are really 
## even taking that into account but i think more  




1525
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:26,000
## and more people are actually on boarding this 
## attitude which i think is another great indicator  




1526
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:32,720
## uh i think there are other great indicators we 
## could point at but i guess it depends on the  




1527
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:40,640
## way you see it and i guess also whether you're 
## an optimist or you're a pessimist and um and  




1528
02:32:42,319 --> 02:32:46,080
## we don't think that you should just do 
## one thing anyway like people should do  




1529
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:49,920
## what they think is effective and they should be 
## as effective as they can possibly be doing it  




1530
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:56,880
## and uh we need people fighting in politics we 
## need people fighting in government we need people  




1531
02:32:56,880 --> 02:33:01,760
## fighting in corporate we need people fighting on 
## the streets we need people fighting in hollywood  




1532
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:07,599
## it doesn't stop this fight is is multi-faceted 
## and it needs to continue at every level  




1533
02:33:09,359 --> 02:33:15,359
## yeah absolutely i think also something that's not 
## being considered is that although some countries  




1534
02:33:15,359 --> 02:33:20,719
## uh there may be reductions in how much how much 
## animal products are being produced right or how  




1535
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:25,680
## many people are consuming them or using them 
## um whereas other countries are on the rise like  




1536
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:30,720
## for example unfortunately india is one of those 
## countries uh where i know we have a few indians  




1537
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:35,120
## here in the chat who can you can also you know 
## vouch for this that the amount of animal products  




1538
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:40,240
## specifically meat uh being consumed in india is 
## actually increasing and there are other countries  




1539
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:45,040
## uh especially in the east who are having the same 
## situation previously they had very low consumption  




1540
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:50,080
## and now because of the western influence they are 
## consuming more whereas it seems like some western  




1541
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:55,040
## countries are on the flip side of that they're 
## consuming less so this is you know without without  




1542
02:33:55,040 --> 02:34:00,720
## the hard data to really show and really dive into 
## everything that's happening we can't just make  




1543
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:06,080
## a general statement that we're losing you know 
## we need to actually look at which countries are  




1544
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:14,160
## having an impact and which aren't and why and dig 
## deep into each situation right um and i agree with  




1545
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:19,040
## everything you said also about um you know getting 
## the message right and it's reassuring to know that  




1546
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:23,600
## the more people are starting to be more 
## unapologetic i think the word would be  




1547
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:30,880
## about defending the animals yeah yeah and i also 
## want to say that we don't have definitive numbers  




1548
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:38,640
## either way on this on the amount of animals being 
## oppressed so i am skeptical of whatever data  




1549
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:45,520
## people are using to make these assumptions or to 
## make these declarations about where things are in  




1550
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:54,241
## terms of the numbers so i i question that because 
## i remember when a bite-sized vegan did a video  




1551
02:34:54,960 --> 02:35:02,399
## and she was trying to in that video give people 
## the kill count and even she concluded in that
