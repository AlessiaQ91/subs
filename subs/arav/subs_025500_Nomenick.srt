02:55:01,279 --> 02:55:07,679
## guess what i'm trying to say is like assume good 
## intentions stop assuming bad intentions of people  




1756
02:55:07,680 --> 02:55:12,560
## um whoever you're talking to really like give 
## them a chance to prove themselves to be you know  




1757
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:18,559
## good don't don't look for bad look for good and 
## assume they want the best i think is it's really  




1758
02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:23,200
## important we'll have one more question and then 
## we'll close off it's it's a it's a nice question  




1759
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:30,240
## i think um do the where's the money go people 
## have any idea how much unpaid work that you guys  




1760
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:37,840
## have put into animal rights do you think thank 
## you generally that's a refreshing perspective  




1761
02:55:38,399 --> 02:55:47,359
## to hear and not just for our case and uh it's not 
## just refreshing for us to hear for you know when  




1762
02:55:47,359 --> 02:55:52,559
## i think about us and that and the criticisms that 
## we get it's also refreshing to hear that any other  




1763
02:55:53,680 --> 02:55:58,400
## activist on behalf of any other activist 
## that gets similar criticisms like this  




1764
02:55:59,439 --> 02:56:01,519
## you know i don't think that 
## animal rights activists  




1765
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:12,399
## are um getting the opportunity given to them 
## all the respects given to them that they deserve  




1766
02:56:12,960 --> 02:56:20,960
## in terms of acquiring financial security whilst 
## being an animal rights activist full-time




1767
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:29,680
## if there's any question about 
## motives then you just have to look at  




1768
02:56:31,359 --> 02:56:35,519
## you know like this person has graciously pointed 
## out and i think i think it's refreshing because  




1769
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:41,600
## it's it's the kind of perspective that really 
## people should have is looking more deeply at  




1770
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:46,880
## the work that people do and that doesn't 
## lie and if it is a question about motives  




1771
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:51,679
## then yeah look at all the work we've done 
## when we had no money towards any of this  




1772
02:56:51,680 --> 02:56:57,201
## and we put all of our own personal money 
## towards everything it's when we went broke  




1773
02:56:58,399 --> 02:57:02,160
## putting all of our money into a b from the 
## beginning and we will continue to do that  




1774
02:57:03,359 --> 02:57:09,519
## to the very end for the for the simple fact 
## that it's about the mission it's about what  




1775
02:57:10,240 --> 02:57:17,599
## the organization is intended for and uh well 
## you know that's the thing i yeah i don't know  




1776
02:57:17,600 --> 02:57:23,600
## what else to say about this i guess you want 
## to answer that yes i just want animal rights  




1777
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:28,960
## activists to feel that it's a very viable option 
## for them to come into animal rights as an activist  




1778
02:57:28,960 --> 02:57:34,560
## to be an activist full-time part-time 
## and to have financial security and not to




1779
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:43,840
## expect that they're going 
## to be walking on on hot coal  




1780
02:57:45,279 --> 02:57:51,439
## just because they they do want financial 
## security while being by you know while being an  




1781
02:57:51,439 --> 02:57:58,000
## animal rights activists i know that we probably 
## entertain on this stream we probably entertain  




1782
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:04,479
## the accusations maybe too much i don't know 
## i'll walk back and i'll judge later but uh  




1783
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:11,040
## that's why i think it's important to just know 
## that you know we need to hold a certain priesthood  




1784
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:17,120
## and set a certain tone for animal rights activists 
## in this movement who may be wanting to come into  




1785
02:58:17,120 --> 02:58:21,279
## this maybe they want to come into this movement 
## and become an activist or maybe they're maybe  




1786
02:58:21,279 --> 02:58:28,080
## you're already an activist and you know i want 
## them to understand that there's nothing wrong with  




1787
02:58:28,720 --> 02:58:32,960
## fighting for the animals whilst also acquiring 
## financial security as long as your motive is not  




1788
02:58:32,960 --> 02:58:42,000
## financial to begin with yeah absolutely and 
## we'll wrap it up there i'll just say that um  




1789
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:47,359
## i hope that you said we gave too much attention 
## to some of these topics and i would be you know  




1790
02:58:47,359 --> 02:58:53,279
## likely to agree but um tended to agree but i think 
## what i was trying to achieve here is to have this  




1791
02:58:53,279 --> 02:58:57,279
## be in my opinion like the last the last time i'm 
## going to talk about any of this anyway and i hope  




1792
02:58:57,279 --> 02:59:01,120
## the last time you also talk about it because this 
## is going to go up on my channel now and it's going  




1793
02:59:01,120 --> 02:59:06,720
## to have sectors marked for every single topic so 
## that any time anything does come up about this  




1794
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:11,200
## and and you know someone's saying asking you hey 
## what do i say to this you can literally say to  




1795
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:15,599
## them go and find you know the topic that they're 
## talking about copy paste and if they don't want to  




1796
02:59:15,600 --> 02:59:20,160
## watch the video well [ __ ] them then you know 
## like they want to keep making accusations fine  




1797
02:59:20,160 --> 02:59:23,279
## but if they want to know the truth well we've 
## answered it it's right here that was the goal  




1798
02:59:23,279 --> 02:59:27,439
## for this so you're right we did give it too much 
## attention but that's because this was the goal  




1799
02:59:27,439 --> 02:59:35,120
## i don't think most of these accusations deserved 
## even five seconds of time but i i do i do i do  




1800
02:59:35,120 --> 02:59:39,920
## think it's important to have it somewhere so that 
## it's dealt with for good you know in my opinion  




1801
02:59:39,920 --> 02:59:44,240
## and that's kind of what i wanted to achieve today 
## and i hope we've achieved that um thank you both  




1802
02:59:44,240 --> 02:59:48,719
## for coming here and doing this you didn't have to 
## do it and i think people overlook that as well you  




1803
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:52,880
## you you don't owe anyone anything and you did not 
## have to sit here and answer these questions and  




1804
02:59:52,880 --> 02:59:57,200
## they weren't nice questions they were shitty 
## questions um i know what it feels like to be  




1805
02:59:57,200 --> 03:00:01,040
## attacked i know what it feels like to be called 
## these things and i know how horrible it feels
